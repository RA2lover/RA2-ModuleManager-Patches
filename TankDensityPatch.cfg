//Individual Stock density adjustments, roughly in order with KSP's "size" sorting.

//How volume estimations were made:
//Spheres are squished as similar-diameter cylinders(=2/3 diameter in height)
//Capsules/Toruses have fairly straightforward mappable volume formulas.
//Frustrum-like parts are assumed to be conical frustrums with base areas matching their corresponding profile's cross-section areas
//These can be seen through the Debug menu -> Physics -> Aero -> Display Aero Data in Action Menus.

//For future reference:
//size 0:	~0.3068 m², 0.3125m radius
//size 1:	~1.2272 m², 0.625m radius
//mk 2: 	2.5000 m², ~0.8921m radius
//size 2:	~4.9087 m², 1.25m radius
//mk 3a:	~9.1805 m², ~1.7095m radius
//mk 3b:	~10.408 m², ~1.8201m radius
//size 3:	~11.045 m², 1.875m radius

//regular-size cross-sections have been calculated from the area of their corresponding circles.
//Mk2 cross-section area has been guesstimated by slightly increasing the drag cube area.
//Mk3b cross-section has been obtained by taking a size 3 cross-section, then chopping out 60 degree circular segments on both sides.
//Mk3a also assumes a 1.25m diameter section has been removed from the center to let kerbals through the hatches shown on tanks.
//This balancing pass assumes a mk3a profile for full fuselages, and a mk3b profile for adapters.

//Stratus-V Minified is fine as is.
//Xenon tanks and ore tanks are out of scope due to not having enough containers to establish a clear baseline. 


//OSCAR-B used to have a smaller capacity in the past, so i assume the fact it's denser than other fuel tanks is intentional.
//Same with the R-12 tank.
//As such i don't have a clear idea of what to do with foil tanks:
//We'll take the Mk0 fuselage as a baseline: 0.9375m in height, 0.3125m in radius = ~287.6L
//Squishing the R-4 into a 0.3125m cylinder, you'd get a cylinder 42.(3) cm tall(=45.1(5)% volume), making it ~11.4% less dense.
//Similarly, the R-11 takes up a volume of ~319.58L while storing 54 units of fuel. Looks close enough.
//If i were to rebalance them, i'd dramatically lower their temperature tolerance while slightly increasing their fuel/mass ratio.
//This would make them better options for space-only vehicles but the lack of larger foil tanks hinders this.


//---

//Stratus-V Roundified could have its volume increased to 25 units to make it not act like a FL-R10 reskin.
//That said, monopropellant tank mass fractions change enough to make me want to delay this change for now.

//---

//Mk0 fuselage has a fuel/tank ratio of 10 instead of 8 like conventional liquid fuel tanks.
//Its size already matches the FL-T400, so nothing to change there.
